### This program is hard-coded to concatinate and write out the fastq files for the DNA sequencing runs of the 2 parental a_marmorata and their 7 offspring ###

### Location of the three flow cells for the dna sequencing. Two lanes per flow cell. Paired end data. So we need to concatinate 6 files total for R1 and 6 files total for R2.
